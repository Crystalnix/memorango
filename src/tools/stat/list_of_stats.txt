 Here are marks of implemented statistics fields.
 With sign '?' marked props, which are impossible / useless / out of context into Go reimplemetation,
 but possibly will be somehow implemented in future.

 ================================== Items ==========================================

The following item values are defined as of writing.
|Name                   |Meaning
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
|number              k +|Number of items presently stored in this class. Expired
|                       |items are not automatically excluded.
|age                 k +|Age of the oldest item in the LRU.
|evicted                |Number of times an item had to be evicted from the LRU
|                       |before it expired.
|                       |
|evicted_nonzero       ?|Number of times an item which had an explicit expire
|                       | time set had to be evicted from the LRU before it
|                       |expired.
|evicted_time          -| Seconds since the last access for the most recent item
|                       | evicted from this class. Use this to judge how
|                       | recently active your evicted data is.
|outofmemory           +| Number of times the underlying slab class was unable to
|                       | store a new item. This means you are running with -M or
|                       | an eviction failed.
|tailrepairs           -| Number of times we self-healed a slab with a refcount
|                       |leak. If this counter is increasing a lot, please
|                       |report your situation to the developers.
|reclaimed             -|Number of times an entry was stored using memory from
|                       |an expired entry.
|expired_unfetched   k +|Number of expired items reclaimed from the LRU which
|                       |were never touched after being set.
|evicted_unfetched   k +|Number of valid items evicted from the LRU which were
|                       |never touched after being set.
|crawler_reclaimed   k +|Number of items freed by the LRU Crawler.
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------

 ================================== Conns ==========================================

The following "stat" keywords may be present:
|---------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                | Meaning                                              |
|---------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| addr                | The address of the remote side. For listening        | +
|                     | sockets this is the listen address. Note that some   |
|                     | socket types (such as UNIX-domain) don't have        |
|                     | meaningful remote addresses.                         |
| state               | The current state of the connection. See below.      | +
| secs_since_last_cmd | The number of seconds since the most recently        | +
|                     | issued command on the connection. This measures      |
|                     | the time since the start of the command, so if       |
|                     | "state" indicates a command is currently executing,  |
|                     | this will be the number of seconds the current       |
|                     | command has been running.                            |
|---------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
The value of the "state" stat may be one of the following:
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Name           | Meaning                                                   |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| conn_closing   | Shutting down the connection.                             |
| conn_listening | Listening for new connections or a new UDP request.       |
| conn_mwrite    | Writing a complex response, e.g., to a "get" command.     |
| conn_new_cmd   | Connection is being prepared to accept a new command.     |
| conn_nread     | Reading extended data, typically for a command such as    |
|                | "set" or "put".                                           |
| conn_parse_cmd | The server has received a command and is in the middle    |
|                | of parsing it or executing it.                            |
| conn_read      | Reading newly-arrived command data.                       |
| conn_swallow   | Discarding excess input, e.g., after an error has         |
|                | occurred.                                                 |
| conn_waiting   | A partial command has been received and the server is     |
|                | waiting for the rest of it to arrive (note the difference |
|                | between this and conn_nread).                             |
| conn_write     | Writing a simple response (anything that doesn't involve  |
|                | sending back multiple lines of response data).            |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
